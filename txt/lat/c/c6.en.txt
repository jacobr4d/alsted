CHAPTER VI.  
On Prudence.  

PRECEPTS.  

PRACTICAL HABIT (namely adventitious and necessary) is prudence, by which one is inclined to assent to practical conclusions.  

Its property is to form practical conclusions through discourse.  

RULES.  

1. Prudence regards the practical good, that is, the honorable; insofar as it is proven from its principles.  
Just as intelligence in theoretical matters is a noetic habit, and science a dianoetic habit: so in practical matters, synderesis is a noetic habit, and prudence a dianoetic habit, and therefore proves practical conclusions from practical principles, just as science proves theoretical conclusions from homogeneous principles.  
However, this differs in that demonstration is not properly called for in prudence, but taken broadly.  
For here, there are not necessary things, in which a property must be demonstrated of the subject; but contingent ones, that is, such as depend on our will, in which it is sought that they be done by us, not truly that they be known by us.  
Moreover, prudence in Ethics is a moral habit; in this place, it is an intellectual habit.  

II. Conclusions, which are deduced from practical principles, are necessarily either in general or in particular.  
Conclusions necessary in general are those that contribute to the common good and to preserving the utility of the state.  
They are necessary in particular when they are determined by a particular circumstance.  
Those that are necessary in general can change in particular while the general remains.  
Of this kind are many laws of emperors and princes.  
For they always aim at the safety of the state and order their laws to confirm it.  
Thus, for example, this law: No one shall climb the rampart.  
This law is necessary in general, not in particular.  
In general, insofar as it contributes to the safety of the state.  
In particular, however, it is not necessary because there may arise a case where a law is enacted that obliges someone to climb the rampart.  
To this pertains the rule: A general law yields to a special one.  
So this law: No one shall take usury: is necessary in general, insofar as it serves the safety of the state and is convenient for citizens.  
In particular, however, it is not necessary because it may happen that due to human vices, it does not achieve its proposed end, that is, it is neither useful to the state nor convenient for citizens.  
Therefore, if the magistrate, to prevent a greater inconvenience, permits moderate usury, such as taking five or six per hundred, so that citizens are helped in this way, he does not overturn the prior law but adds an exception to it.  
Therefore, it is carefully considered which hypotheses are necessary in particular, or simply ἁπλῶς, and which in general, or κατὰ τί, according to what is stated.  
This distinction indeed can clarify many questions and shows that although all honest laws are constructed from the axioms of the law of nature, it is not necessary that we have the same laws in particular as the French, Italians, or Poles.
For any magistrate, αἰνὸς δίκιωϛ, can establish laws useful to his state, provided he does nothing against the rule of nature.  
Indeed, the same magistrate can have different laws in different domains if either the condition of people or the utility of the state demands it.  
Although these diverse laws may vary in particular, they beautifully agree in general and do not conflict with each other.  
Of this place is also the rule: Nature dictates something in three ways: Some things it dictates to be necessarily done; others it shows must necessarily be avoided; finally, it leaves some things in the middle.  
What nature dictates to be necessarily done, when they are done, are just everywhere and among all; and that by nature, not opinion.  
Of this kind are the proper actions of all virtues, which are demonstrated from the principles of nature.  
What nature judges must necessarily be avoided, when they are done, are unjust everywhere and among all, again by nature, not opinion.  
These are all actions that deviate even slightly from the proper actions of virtues.  
What it leaves in the middle are free, so that one is neither called just nor unjust, whether he does them or omits them.  
These are called by the Greeks μεσα and ἀδιάφορα, middles and indifferent things.  
Thus, climbing the city's rampart or not climbing it is left free by the law of nature.  
But where the magistrate's decree intervenes, which forbids anyone from climbing the rampart, he who climbs the rampart despite the magistrate's decree is to be considered a transgressor of justice and law; and on the contrary, he who refrains because of the magistrate's edict is to be considered just in that part of the law.  
About this third category, it can be questioned whether, by a passed law, it is naturally unjust to climb the rampart.  
For it seems that it is unjust by opinion alone.  
We say it was naturally free, but once the voice of the magistrate, which regards the end of nature, namely the safety of the state, intervenes, whoever violates this law transgresses the bounds of nature; and it becomes naturally unjust, not indeed ἁπλῶς, but κατὰ τί, on account of the end which nature regards in actions pertaining to preserving the safety of human society.  
For the law of nature dictates this rule: Whatever contributes to the glory of God, likewise to the common good, and finally to the private utility or perfection of each one, is according to nature.  
For this is the threefold end of everything, which preserves its nature; and therefore, it is according to nature.

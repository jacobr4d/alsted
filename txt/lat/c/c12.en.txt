CHAPTER XII.

On the Possession and Exercise of Intellectual Habits.

PRECEPTS.

What remains is the possession and exercise of the habits enumerated thus far.

The possession (κτῆσις) of these habits is either simple or conjunct.

Simple possession is that by which individual habits are possessed; conjunct, by which multiple are possessed.

The exercise (χρῆσις) of habits is that by which they produce their operations.

RULES.

I. The possession of habits is analogous to acquisition.
In any habit, these three things are observed: acquisition, possession, and exercise.
The acquisition of intellectual habits has been explained in the preceding doctrine.
For innate habits depend on nature; acquired ones are obtained either by one's own effort or by the benefit of another, namely, God infusing them, and teachers instructing.
Possession corresponds to acquisition.
Therefore, since habits are acquired either individually, separately, or in combination, their possession is likewise simple or conjunct, and indeed in this way.
Individual habits are possessed such that a simple denomination arises from them: for example, from wisdom, they are called wise; from prudence, prudent; from art, artisans, etc.
Conjunct habits are possessed such that a composite denomination arises from them.
Thus, wisdom is joined with prudence, liberal art with non-liberal, etc., and thereby learned men are called prudent and artisans.
Moreover, intellectual habits are not only joined among themselves, but also with moral habits and certain other adjuncts, whether good or bad, in this manner: And thus indeed are habits possessed, either individually or conjointly.
Both are moreover possessed in an excellent or diminished degree: ordinarily or extraordinarily: exemplarily or commonly, etc.

II. The exercise of habits is analogous to possession.
As is the acquisition of habits, so is possession; and as is possession, so is exercise.
Thus, habits are exercised either individually or conjointly; and both commendably, or otherwise; exemplarily, or commonly, etc.
Furthermore, the exercise of habits is sometimes internal, sometimes external; sometimes easier, sometimes more difficult, etc.
This matter is discussed throughout this Encyclopedia.

CONCLUSION OF THE HEXILOGY.
Thus stands the Hexilogy, the first part of the Cyclopedic Alphabet: 
from which must be sought the true kinds of habitual disciplines, namely wisdom, knowledge, prudence, and art; 
then the sources of true cognition and good action, namely intelligence and synderesis; 
finally, the manner by which people proceed in cognition, which is threefold; 
namely, necessarily true, or apodictic, contingently true, or dialectic, and finally false, or sophistic.

Learning is associated with
├── Some External 
│   ├── Good, which adorns no less than a beautiful woman does the world. Thus, some good is joined to learning
│   │   ├── Of the Body: such as strength, beauty, health. Hence learned athletes, boxers, beauties.
│   │   └── Of Fortune: such as status. Hence learned princes.
│   └── Evil & inconvenience, which, although it interferes with learning by itself, makes the wise person more commendable when they overcome these impediments through the pursuit of virtue. Thus, some evil is joined to learning
│       ├── Of the Body: such as
│       │   ├── Poor health. Hence learned invalids.
│       │   └── Weakness of sex. Hence learned women.
│       └── Of Fortune: such as poverty. Hence those who became learned despite being poor.
└── An Internal Habit
    ├── Good
    │   ├── Intellectual
    │   │   ├── Liberal. Hence Philosopher-theologians, Philosopher-physicians, etc.
    │   │   └── Illiberal. Hence learned men also renowned in mechanics.
    │   └── Moral. Hence learned men who are legislators, counselors, magistrates, military leaders.
    └── Bad; which, although it neither adds to nor detracts from the perfection of learning, often considerably inconveniences practice. Hence, a bad habit is joined to learning.
        ├── Theoretical: such as error.
        └── Practical
            ├── Ethical: such as wickedness.
            │   ├── Ineptitude. Hence learned men inept in economy, politics, etc.
            │   └── Wickedness. Hence learned men who are greedy, impious, tyrannical, etc.
            └── Mechanical. Hence learned men inept in mechanics.

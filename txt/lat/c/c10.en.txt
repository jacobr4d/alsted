CHAPTER X.

On Error.

PRECEPTS.

Thus concerning true dispositions: a false disposition follows, namely error, a defect of the intellect, whereby one is inclined to assent to false conclusions.

And it is either human or bestial.

Human error is that which can be corrected.

Bestial (bestial) is that by which one errs infinitely.

RULES.

I. Error does not occur concerning first principles, but concerning conclusions. 
Meanwhile, it often happens that Sophists use their conclusions as if they were principles, although they are not truly principles.

II. Error differs from false opinion in two ways. 
First, in error, there is an assent whose falsehood is evidently established; then it is not deemed probable but evident and certain, drawn from an evident syllogism, but truly deceptive and deceitful. 
However, false opinion, even if it is truly false, must have a probable assent; such that its falsehood is not evidently established, even if there are effective reasons against it. 
Moreover, the syllogism by which it is proved must be probable or considered certain, so that it is not deemed evident by all the wise. 
Hence, whenever someone holds an opinion, they feel probably that it is true, and know neither a dialectical nor a probable syllogism. 
But when they advance further, deceived by a spurious syllogism (as Aristotle calls it) or a falsifying one, so that they regard some conclusion as evidently true, when in fact it is evidently false, there arises error: because they regard a conclusion as evident that is truly deceptive, possessing only an appearance of goodness, or certainly deceived concerning the premises, judge one or both to be evident, although they are evidently false.

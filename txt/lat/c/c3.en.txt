CHAPTER 3.

On the light of nature, that is, on understanding, synderesis, conscience, and poetic understanding.

PRECEPTS.

Hexilogia in special follows, which pursues the special divisions of intellectual habits, and possession combined with exercise.
The special divisions are as follows:
Intellectual habit is of the present life, or of the future.
The habit of the present life is true or false.
The true habit is innate, or adventitious.
The innate habit is the light of nature itself, which still remains somewhat in man.

The light of nature, as remaining in man, is the splendor of divine wisdom, through which we discern the light, that is, the evidence and firmness of the first principles, and the conclusions dependent on them.
Here we consider the light of nature with regard to the first principles.

The light of nature is in the intellect partly theoretical, partly practical, partly poetic.

The light of nature in the theoretical intellect is called Intelligence; in the practical intellect it is called the law of nature, which synderesis preserves, and to which conscience attends.

Intelligence is the contemplative habit by which man is inclined to firmly and evidently assent to the first theoretical principles.
Otherwise it is called intelligence in the strict sense and intellect; as well as the intellect of speculative principles; likewise the knowledge of the principles of science and demonstration; in Greek "the mind."

Synderesis is the practical habit by which man is rendered inclined to firmly and evidently assent to the first practical principles in thesis.
Otherwise it is called the knowledge of the principles of action.

Conscience is the practical habit by which man is rendered inclined to firmly and evidently assent to the first practical principles applied to himself.

Poetic intelligence is the habit by which one is inclined to firmly assent to the first poetic principles.
It is also called organic intelligence, and artificial intelligence.

RULES.

I. The light of nature is a habit implanted in man at the first creation, so that by its benefit he may understand what is true and good.
God is pure light, and, as the Greeks elegantly say, "self-luminous."
Hence all His works are full of light; and they are the works of God in so far as they are endowed with light.
That light, which the Father of lights implanted in man at the first creation, is called the light of nature, which is a certain ray of divine light, shining in the mount or intellect of man; although by its nature it is one, yet it is rightly divided into theoretical and practical, according to the object and mode; to which others add poetic.
The light of nature in the theoretical intellect is called Intelligence; in the practical, the Law of nature; in the practical, Organic Intelligence.
Let us therefore first consider intelligence.

II. Intelligence is the habit of theoretical principles, inclining the intellect to operate well concerning them.
Whatever we understand anywhere is either a principle or a conclusion.
The habit inclining the mind to rightly contemplate theoretical principles is called intelligence.
For since our intellect can be disposed indifferently to operate well or ill concerning theoretical principles, it must be determined to operate well: this is done through this habit.
Thus, for example, "God is" is a theoretical principle.
How badly the intellect operates concerning this principle is exemplified by the diversity of religions.
Hence, since the intellect can consider this theoretical principle well or ill, it is determined by this habit to act well.
It is determined, I say, to a firm and evident assent to this principle and similar ones, and also to readily eliciting it.
However, because this habit is produced without a medium, without discourse, and without art, only through the natural light of the intellect, it is signified by the name of intellect, a truly august nomenclature.

III. Intelligence assents to the first theoretical principles without any medium or argument. 
The nature or essence of a power and habit must be derived from its own act and object. 
For it is from these that powers and habits derive their specific characteristics. 
Thus, we will investigate the nature and form of intelligence in the same way. 
Therefore, the proper and formal, as they call it, object of intelligence is the immediate theoretical truth, that is, a theoretical principle whose predicate adheres to the subject without any medium: such as, God is, The whole is greater than its part, Twice two is four.
Here indeed no cause can be given why the thing is so. 
However, the act or mode by which intelligence aims at its object is the evident and immediate apprehension and judgment of those immediacies, that is, simply the first principles: which are elegantly called by the Greeks "self-evident." 
Therefore, there is no medium here: neither apodictic or demonstrative and necessary, as it is in science; nor dialectic or probable, as it is in opinion; nor any testimony, whether it be fallible, as in human faith, or infallible, as in divine faith. 
How then, someone might ask, does this habit reach principles? 
Thus, I say, it reaches them by being content with the knowledge of the terms and the species of those terms: which species are produced by the active intellect and imprinted on the passive or receptive intellect, through the media of sensible species or phantasms. 
Thus informed by these species of principles, and understanding through them the meaning of the terms, they assent to those principles without any art or skill, without any medium or discourse: and through such assent, the habit of principles is generated, which is later intensified and perfected through frequent repetition of the same assent. 
Hence it is clear that this habit is partly natural, that is, innate, and partly acquired. 
Indeed, it is natural in its beginning; but acquired, in so far as it is obtained through its own acts or frequent repetition, though without any medium, without any art, solely through the operation and power of the active and passive intellect and the senses.
Moreover, the act of intelligence is twofold: apprehension of terms and noetic judgment.
The first is called material, the second, formal.

IV. Intelligence differs in species from Synderesis.
Intelligence is the habit of theoretical principles and is called the intellect of speculative principles.
Synderesis is the habit of practical principles and is called the intellect of active principles.
These two habits differ in species because their objects differ in species.
For theoretical principles, which are by their nature ordered towards knowing, differ in species from practical principles, which are by their nature ordered towards acting honorably.
There is a certain rule: habits and acts are distinguished in species by objects that are distinct in species.
On poetic intelligence, see shortly in chapter 7.

V. Synderesis preserves in the intellect the highest distinctions of good and evil, or honorable and base; from which it also derives its name.
Synderesis is the habit of practical principles, named thus because it conserves the law of nature ("it preserves").
Hence, what the intellect is in theoretical matters—that is, the habit of theoretical principles, engaged in the intelligence and discretion of true and false—such is synderesis in practical matters, set in the discretion of good and evil, and thus preserving the distinction between honorable and base.
And this habit is added to the practical intellect, just as intelligence is added to the theoretical intellect.

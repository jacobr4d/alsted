CHAPTER 3.

On the light of nature, that is, on understanding, synderesis, conscience, and poetic understanding.

PRECEPTS.

Hexilogia in special follows, which pursues the special divisions of intellectual habits, and possession combined with exercise.
The special divisions are as follows:
Intellectual habit is of the present life, or of the future.
The habit of the present life is true or false.
The true habit is innate, or adventitious.
The innate habit is the light of nature itself, which still remains somewhat in man.

The light of nature, as remaining in man, is the splendor of divine wisdom, through which we discern the light, that is, the evidence and firmness of the first principles, and the conclusions dependent on them.
Here we consider the light of nature with regard to the first principles.

The light of nature is in the intellect partly theoretical, partly practical, partly poetic.

The light of nature in the theoretical intellect is called Intelligence; in the practical intellect it is called the law of nature, which synderesis preserves, and to which conscience attends.

Intelligence is the contemplative habit by which man is inclined to firmly and evidently assent to the first theoretical principles.
Otherwise it is called intelligence in the strict sense and intellect; as well as the intellect of speculative principles; likewise the knowledge of the principles of science and demonstration; in Greek "the mind."

Synderesis is the practical habit by which man is rendered inclined to firmly and evidently assent to the first practical principles in thesis.
Otherwise it is called the knowledge of the principles of action.

Conscience is the practical habit by which man is rendered inclined to firmly and evidently assent to the first practical principles applied to himself.

Poetic intelligence is the habit by which one is inclined to firmly assent to the first poetic principles.
It is also called organic intelligence, and artificial intelligence.

RULES.

I. The light of nature is a habit implanted in man at the first creation, so that by its benefit he may understand what is true and good.
God is pure light, and, as the Greeks elegantly say, "self-luminous."
Hence all His works are full of light; and they are the works of God in so far as they are endowed with light.
That light, which the Father of lights implanted in man at the first creation, is called the light of nature, which is a certain ray of divine light, shining in the mount or intellect of man; although by its nature it is one, yet it is rightly divided into theoretical and practical, according to the object and mode; to which others add poetic.
The light of nature in the theoretical intellect is called Intelligence; in the practical, the Law of nature; in the practical, Organic Intelligence.
Let us therefore first consider intelligence.

II. Intelligence is the habit of theoretical principles, inclining the intellect to operate well concerning them.
Whatever we understand anywhere is either a principle or a conclusion.
The habit inclining the mind to rightly contemplate theoretical principles is called intelligence.
For since our intellect can be disposed indifferently to operate well or ill concerning theoretical principles, it must be determined to operate well: this is done through this habit.
Thus, for example, "God is" is a theoretical principle.
How badly the intellect operates concerning this principle is exemplified by the diversity of religions.
Hence, since the intellect can consider this theoretical principle well or ill, it is determined by this habit to act well.
It is determined, I say, to a firm and evident assent to this principle and similar ones, and also to readily eliciting it.
However, because this habit is produced without a medium, without discourse, and without art, only through the natural light of the intellect, it is signified by the name of intellect, a truly august nomenclature.

III. Intelligence assents to the first theoretical principles without any medium or argument. 
The nature or essence of a power and habit must be derived from its own act and object. 
For it is from these that powers and habits derive their specific characteristics. 
Thus, we will investigate the nature and form of intelligence in the same way. 
Therefore, the proper and formal, as they call it, object of intelligence is the immediate theoretical truth, that is, a theoretical principle whose predicate adheres to the subject without any medium: such as, God is, The whole is greater than its part, Twice two is four.
Here indeed no cause can be given why the thing is so. 
However, the act or mode by which intelligence aims at its object is the evident and immediate apprehension and judgment of those immediacies, that is, simply the first principles: which are elegantly called by the Greeks "self-evident." 
Therefore, there is no medium here: neither apodictic or demonstrative and necessary, as it is in science; nor dialectic or probable, as it is in opinion; nor any testimony, whether it be fallible, as in human faith, or infallible, as in divine faith. 
How then, someone might ask, does this habit reach principles? 
Thus, I say, it reaches them by being content with the knowledge of the terms and the species of those terms: which species are produced by the active intellect and imprinted on the passive or receptive intellect, through the media of sensible species or phantasms. 
Thus informed by these species of principles, and understanding through them the meaning of the terms, they assent to those principles without any art or skill, without any medium or discourse: and through such assent, the habit of principles is generated, which is later intensified and perfected through frequent repetition of the same assent. 
Hence it is clear that this habit is partly natural, that is, innate, and partly acquired. 
Indeed, it is natural in its beginning; but acquired, in so far as it is obtained through its own acts or frequent repetition, though without any medium, without any art, solely through the operation and power of the active and passive intellect and the senses.
Moreover, the act of intelligence is twofold: apprehension of terms and noetic judgment.
The first is called material, the second, formal.

IV. Intelligence differs in species from Synderesis.
Intelligence is the habit of theoretical principles and is called the intellect of speculative principles.
Synderesis is the habit of practical principles and is called the intellect of active principles.
These two habits differ in species because their objects differ in species.
For theoretical principles, which are by their nature ordered towards knowing, differ in species from practical principles, which are by their nature ordered towards acting honorably.
There is a certain rule: habits and acts are distinguished in species by objects that are distinct in species.
On poetic intelligence, see shortly in chapter 7.

V. Synderesis preserves in the intellect the highest distinctions of good and evil, or honorable and base; from which it also derives its name.
Synderesis is the habit of practical principles, named thus because it conserves the law of nature ("it preserves").
Hence, what the intellect is in theoretical matters—that is, the habit of theoretical principles, engaged in the intelligence and discretion of true and false—such is synderesis in practical matters, set in the discretion of good and evil, and thus preserving the distinction between honorable and base.
And this habit is added to the practical intellect, just as intelligence is added to the theoretical intellect.

VI. Synderesis differs from the law of nature, and from conscience, in that the law of nature contains the principles of common law themselves; Synderesis is the habit of those principles, indeed one that never errs; conscience, finally, is the habit of applying the law of nature to a certain fact in a conclusive manner, but in such a way that it often errs.  
The law is the standard of what should be done.  
And it is either unwritten or written.  
The unwritten law is the law of nature itself, which God has engraved on the minds of all humans, to discern the distinction between the honorable and the shameful.  
It is otherwise called the law of nature, because it is a certain command of nature: also the divine law, which has God as its author: finally, the eternal law, because it is not a written, but a born law, which we have not learned, received, read, but have seized, drawn, and expressed from nature itself: to which we are not taught, but made, not instructed, but imbued, as are the words of Cicero for Milo.  
Sophocles calls it "an unwritten divine decree, firm and safe": Aristotle says "through the soul", whereby all written law derives its force: Demosthenes calls it "the law and ordinance of Zeus".  
Euripides is the author, suggesting that such a great light has shone on us from heaven, that even brighter than Hesperus or Lucifer, and that those things which oppose this great light have emerged from the depths of darkness.  
The law of nature is in truth a certain ray of divine justice shining in the mind, and, like the "expression of the eternal" that law which is in God.  
Therefore, whoever denies or violates this law not only fights with nature but also with God: which is in Greek "opposes God".  
Moreover, it follows from this that the law of nature is immovable, and its rules are not ambiguous opinions or "equivocal" propositions, which cannot be grasped, but firm perceptions of things to be sought and avoided, which firm assent, "with an unerring mind", ought to embrace.  
The principal norms and judgments of the law of nature, however, are: Honorable things are to be loved and defended: Shameful things are to be avoided: No one should be harmed: Everyone should be given their due: Whatever suits a person according to right reason is to be sought: And, whatever conflicts with reason is to be avoided: virtue conforms to right reason, vices do not.  
And thus the law of nature holds, which ought to be the standard of all positive laws.  
Furthermore, the habit that preserves the law of nature, or the practical principles that govern the action of the good, is Synderesis, the better part of the soul, which always urges and provokes to better things.  
This is the guardian and conservatrix of immediate, or indemonstrable propositions in practical matters: this is the attendant steward of those matters: this considers what is expedient, and what is not expedient.  
And for this reason, it is said to supply the proposition in the practical syllogism.  
This synthesis is followed by judgment, like the shadow follows the body.  
However, judgment is the faculty of discerning; which judges deeds as worthy of praise or blame, reward or punishment.  
Conscience is united with synteresis, which is the testimony that each feels within oneself regarding a duty fulfilled or neglected: whence follows defense or accusation, joy or sadness.  
Therefore, synteresis in the syllogism, which is called practical, lays down the general rule in the proposition; conscience assumes concerning the particular fact, and concludes either defense or accusation: from which hope or fear arises.  
For example: synteresis says, What I do not wish to be done to me, I should not do to another.  
Conscience assumes, I do not wish others to deceive me under the guise of friendship.  
Hence it concludes, that I or another do wrong if I deceive another under the hope of friendship.  
Thus for this proposition: Whoever kills a human sins: synteresis supplies.  
Conscience assumes: But you killed a man.  
And at the same time concludes an accusation, by which it convinces you that you have sinned, and therefore must be subjected to punishment.  
He who honors father and mother will be blessed by God: the conscience of a dutiful son assumes: You have honored your parents: and finally concludes: Therefore you will be blessed by the Lord.  
Always, however, joined with synteresis is judgment, just as we have said that the same discerning faculty is joined with understanding.  
From which it follows that the law of nature, synteresis, and conscience necessarily concur in the practical syllogism.  
But by the addition of examples, this entire discussion will be made clearer.  
Synteresis supplied Hector with this principle: To defend one's homeland is honorable, and therefore worthy of praise.  
The conscience of Hector formed this minor premise: But you defend your homeland, so that you do not even refuse to encounter death for it.  
The same conscience formed the conclusion: Therefore you are worthy of praise.  
This syllogism in Hector's mind was followed by joy, which not a little alleviated his spirit in the greatest dangers, indeed made him so spirited that he did not fear to die for his homeland.  
For when he was admonished by the prophet Polydamas not to go to war against the Greeks, he replied:  
    You always talk of flight, fighting alone with the left wing of the bird.  
And when the prophet replied that the flight of birds signified a dire outcome, Hector boldly retorted: whether the birds fly to the right or to the left,  
    to us the great Zeus has established the end.
Calling the counsel of Jupiter, the heroic impulse of mind, he was urged to carry out the matter excellently and honorably.  
For he did not consider there to be any time when things that are honorable should not be done, especially when the safety of the homeland is at stake.  
For according to Euripides, “The noble is always dear.”  
Thus to Constantine the Great, the most praised prince, synteresis supplied this proposition of the law of nature: He who helps the innocent will receive a reward from God.  
His conscience assumed and concluded in this manner: But you help the innocent, therefore you will receive a reward from God.  
Here you will note that the conscience, which in the chosen exists from the Gospel, is much more perfect than the conscience that exists from the law of nature.  
Conversely, synteresis supplied Oedipus with this proposition: He who commits incest and parricide commits a shameful deed, and therefore is worthy of punishment.  
Conscience assumed: But you have committed it.  
The same concluded the accusation.  
This syllogism in the mind of Oedipus, king of the Thebans, was followed by such great sorrow that, unable to endure the shame he had committed, he gouged out his own eyes in his grief.  
Truly, therefore, Menander sings:  
    “He who is conscious of his own evil, is most bold;  
    Conscience itself makes him most timid.”  
He who is conscious of something is most audacious, yet conscience makes him most timid.  
To this pertain the examples of Cain, Saul, Ahithophel, Judas, Francesco Spiera, and others.  
Here these aphorisms about synteresis and conscience should be noted.  
1. From synteresis and conscience arises a practical syllogism, either absolving or condemning a man.  
2. Synteresis is not deceived: but conscience often is, when general principles are not rightly applied to individual acts.  
3. Conscience, when not straying, is the tribunal of God, which he sets up in the hearts of mortals.  
4. He who sins against conscience builds toward hell.  
5. Conscience is a judge, accuser, scribe, and witness in one forum.  
6. Conscience often sleeps for a time, but eventually awakens.  
And in particular, in adverse matters it is roused as by a whip, according to the Sophoclean saying:  
    “When we are afflicted, conscience of crimes is roused.”

To which pertains the fable of the Furies.  
For the Furies are nothing other than the disturbances of the mind from a bad conscience, which perpetually accompany shameful deeds: and for that reason, the Furies are called “remembrancers,” mindful: because they never forget the crime committed and the due punishment.  
And one Fury is called by the poet "the strife and the dispute of the mind," of which the poet mentions in the second book of the Aeneid.  

VII. Synteresis is a noetic habit, just like intelligence.  
For although practical matters depend on theoretical ones, the first practical principles are immediate, since demonstration properly so-called only takes place in necessary matters, such as theoretical ones.

VIII. Conscience is a habit in the practical intellect, adapting a specific act to the rule.  
And first of all, it is a habit because it directs the intellect to operation.  
Then it is in the practical intellect because its actions consist in the use of practical reason, not in choice or rejection.  
For its action, among others, is to adapt the specific act to the rule, that is, to the practical notion which synteresis supplies.  
See rule 6 of the previous regulations for the other actions of conscience.

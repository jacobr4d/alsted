CHAPTER IV.  
On the order of disciplines.

PRECEPTS.

Special technology explains the number of disciplines.

That number is considered in terms of foundation and difference.

The foundation is in the highest categories "the being," that is, of that which can be comprehended by our mind; and also from the highest categories of human imperfection.

The difference of this number is of this kind:

Discipline is homogeneous or heterogeneous.

Homogeneous discipline is of one object, or matter.

And it is total or partial.

Total discipline, or properly speaking, is an entire system of homogeneous precepts.

And it is liberal or illiberal.

Liberal discipline is that which makes a man truly learned and literate.

And it is lower or higher.

Lower discipline is that which serves the higher.

And it is philological or philosophical.

Philological discipline is a system delivering the instruments of philosophy, theology, jurisprudence, and medicine.

And it is pure or intermediate.

Pure philological discipline is that which directs speech or reason only.  
There are Lexicons, Grammar, and Rhetoric: here is Logic.

The intermediate or mixed philological discipline is that which directs speech and reason simultaneously: as Oratory and Poetics.

Philosophical discipline is a system conveying things of such a kind, whose knowledge renders a man a philosopher.

And it is theoretical or practical.

The theoretical philosophical discipline is that which demonstrates the natural knowledge of truth.

And it is general or special.  
The former is Metaphysics; the latter is of substance, like Pneumatics and Physics, or of accident, like Mathematics.

Mathematics is pure or intermediate.  
The former is purely mathematics, like Arithmetic and Geometry; the latter is partly mathematics, partly physics; and it is either concerned with quantity and body, like Cosmography, Uranometry, and Geography, or with quality and body, like Optics and Music.

The practical philosophical discipline is that which demonstrates the action of moral good.

And it is general, like Ethics, or special, like Economics, Politics, and Scholastics.

Higher discipline is that which claims supremacy for itself.

And it is divine, like Theology, or human, like Jurisprudence and Medicine.

An illiberal discipline is that which does not make a man truly literate.

Partial or improperly so-called discipline is a part of some entire system, like Anthropology is a part of Physics.

Heterogeneous discipline is that which compiles its precepts from various homogeneous disciplines.

And it is properly or improperly so-called.  
The former includes Mnemonics, History, Chronology, and Architecture; the latter includes Paradoxology, Gnomology, etc.

RULES.

I. The number of disciplines is defined.  
Because things knowable are finite, and likewise the method of knowing, it is necessary, therefore, that it be defined in terms of the names of sciences or disciplines.  
As for the fact that mechanical arts are said to be infinite, this must be understood not strictly but rather approximately.  
The same judgment applies to infinite mixtures or the "Quodlibets" of disciplines.

II. One and the same person can engage in the study of various disciplines.  
Firstly, there are certain subtle, fiery, heroic, etc., minds that, without any trouble, learn various disciplines; this is not given to ordinary, earthy, slow, etc., minds.  
Furthermore, vocation or duty often requires the knowledge and use of more or fewer disciplines.

III. The number of disciplines ought to be proportionate to the things to be learned, and likewise to the remedying of human imperfection.  
Disciplines derive their name from learning.  
Therefore, their number should be constituted from the variety of things to be learned.  
This matter is indeed of great importance.  
Just as, in a well-ordered republic, it matters greatly that the boundaries of fields, or of the whole province or territory, be correctly established; so it is in the interest of the literary republic that disciplines and their boundaries be properly partitioned, so to speak.  
Here, the first rule is that the number of disciplines should neither be innumerable nor overly fragmented and too brief, but should match and exhaust the very knowable things, according to the rule: Sciences are divided as things themselves: "According to parts, in all things concerning first principles."  
The second rule is that things should not be multiplied according to words.  
Often, in practice, it happens that one and the same thing, and even discipline, is designated by two or more names, e.g., Metaphysics and First Philosophy: Physics and Physiology: Optics and Perspective: Politics and Moral Philosophy, etc.  
The third rule is that parts of disciplines should not be considered as separate and properly defined disciplines, e.g., Stoicheiology is a part of Physics; Aretology, a part of Ethics.  
The fourth rule is that compilations of disciplines should not be confused with the disciplines themselves.  
Moreover, the highest categories of "beings" are three: namely, theoretical, practical, and poetical, that is, entities falling under contemplation, action, and affection.  
Furthermore, theoretical and practical matters are natural or supernatural; poetical matters are liberal or illiberal.  
And all these are treated either individually or collectively.  
Thus, the highest categories of disciplines are derived.  
Moreover, the number of disciplines should be drawn in such a way that it takes into account human imperfection.  
For disciplines have been invented to heal the diseases of mind and body, or to edify them.  
Therefore, as many ways as man is to be healed, so to speak, or edified, there should be as many kinds of disciplines.  
However, man suffers from threefold ailments, namely, ignorance of the mind, malice of the will, and inexperience or sluggishness of mind, tongue, hand, etc.  
The first is expelled by wisdom, the second by prudence, and courage enriches the third.  
Thus, all disciplines can be reduced to these three highest categories.

IV. Philology and philosophy can be defined in two ways.  
Firstly, they are considered absolutely, in themselves; in this sense, Philology is a system of liberal arts, which cultivates speech and reason with certain instruments: Philosophy is a system of sciences and wisdoms, which a man can attain through the light of nature.  
Then they are considered relatively, as they serve the three higher faculties; in this way, Philology is a system of liberal instruments used by the three higher faculties: Philosophy is a system of sciences and wisdoms that prepare the mind for the three higher faculties.

V. Philology is sometimes opposed to philosophy, sometimes it is a part of it.  
This is expressed in Scholastic terms as follows: Philology and philosophy are taken oppositely or compositely.  
Oppositely, in reference to those three highest categories and, so to speak, heads, all liberal disciplines are related to Philology, Philosophy, and Theology.  
Compositely; as philosophy is divided into theoretical, practical, and poetic or organic.  
Thus, Philology is a part of philosophy; because poetic philosophy is precisely Philology itself.

VI. The term Philology is taken broadly or strictly.  
Philology, taken broadly, is the study or love of letters.  
Strictly, it is either the expertise of antiquity or the study or love of speaking or discussing.  
In the former sense, Philology encompasses the knowledge of languages and disciplines that revolve around discourse, and, finally, the knowledge of antiquity.  
It is, I say, a system of all the arts that pave the way to the stronghold of Philosophy.  
Thus, it is understood in Martianus Capella's Book 1 on the marriage of Philology, where he imagines Philology marrying Mercury.  
In the same sense, the renowned grammarian Ateius is called Philologist, as noted by Suetonius in the book on illustrious men.  
Thus, Plutarch in Lucullus says Lucullus was accustomed to "loving words with those who love words."  
And in the life of Cicero and in Athenaeus Book 5, the notion of this term is the same.  
Then, Philology, strictly, is the same as the investigation of antiquity.  
It is taken in this way by Seneca in the book on the death of Claudius; in letter 107, likewise by Photius in the Library.  
Thus, those who today are called antiquarians are called Philologists.  
Finally, this term, again strictly, is taken to mean the comprehension of liberal arts, which revolve around discourse, virtue, and ethics.  
This notion is the one considered in this Encyclopedia.

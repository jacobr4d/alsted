TECHNOLOGY, that is, the Doctrine of the properties, order, & number of disciplines.  

CHAPTER ONE.  
On the properties of disciplines.  
PRECEPTS.  

TECHNOLOGY is according to the previously known disciplines, concerning their nature and series.  
It is called in the same sense Technography.  

And it is general or special.  
General technology explains the properties or affections, order, and general division of the disciplines.  

The properties of disciplines regard the agreement or difference of them.  

The properties of disciplines concerning agreement are absolute or related.

Absolute properties concern disciplines considered in themselves.  
They are of the first or second class.  
Properties of the first class are concerning the end and subject of disciplines.  

Regarding the end, there are two properties: 1. To have a proper, adequate, and possible end, 2. To provide means sufficient to attain that end.  

Regarding the subject, there are likewise two properties: namely, to have a subject, 1. adequate, 2. stable.  

Absolute properties of the second class concern the matter, form, and adjuncts of disciplines.  

Regarding the matter, there are seven properties: namely, to have true, clear, easy, useful, necessary, homogeneous or specifically suitable, and sufficient precepts.  

Regarding the form, this is the property: to have a certain and methodical disposition of precepts; and to have it so arranged that there are two parts of each discipline, one general, the other special; whether the method is synthetic or analytic.  

Regarding adjuncts, it is common to disciplines that they are necessary, useful, certain, pleasant, etc.  

Related properties of disciplines are either concerning Nature, concerning the disciplines themselves, or indeed concerning their essence and existence.  

Regarding Nature, there are two properties; namely that art is an emulator of Nature, and at the same time is a more certain guide than Nature.  

Regarding the disciplines themselves, there are likewise two properties, namely subordination and binding of the forums.  
Subordination is where a lower discipline depends on some higher one: otherwise called subalternation.  

The binding of forums is where all disciplines harmoniously agree with each other.  

Concerning essence and existence, disciplines are either in idea or in subject.  

The properties of disciplines concerning difference are two.  
1. To have a subject of information, treatment, and operations.  
2. To have as the end either the contemplation of truth, the action of virtue, or the provision of instruments subservient to truth or virtue.

RULES.  

I. Technology presents the nature and positions of disciplines.  
Whereby two things must necessarily be known beforehand.  
Thus it happens that we reach a deeper understanding of the nature of any discipline.  
Then it is incredible to say how much this aids memory, if, whenever you read, hear, or see something, you immediately think to which discipline it pertains.  
In addition, it can more easily learn a discipline if its position is held in the realm of Encyclopedia, thus its agreement with other disciplines, and difference from the same.  
Finally, if there is to be a discussion on some theme, it is greatly beneficial to run through the series of disciplines and examine what can be brought forth from each discipline on that theme.  

II. The properties of disciplines are themselves the laws of establishing and examining philosophical disciplines.  
Just as man's properties argue the constitution of man from his matter and form, and are like the Lydian stone, by which the nature of man can and ought to be examined; so too the properties of disciplines are essential conditions required in establishing disciplines, and therefore to be applied in examining them.  
Thus, it is rightly said that they are the same rules for establishing and examining disciplines.

III. Each discipline should have a certain, proper, and adequate end.  
First, each discipline must have an end: because no discipline was invented recklessly or in vain, but all were established for the sake of some good.  
Hence, it is rightly said that God, nature, and art do nothing in vain.  
Then the end must be proper.  
Just as each discipline has its own essence, so too its own end.  
Moreover, that proper end should be commensurate to the general one, which is some perfection of man, and to the subject of each discipline.  
For it is man's imperfection that he cannot accurately know this or that knowable thing, hence it is necessary that a particular discipline remedies a particular deficiency of nature.  
Thus, for example, man cannot perfectly know the nature of the body.  
It is necessary, therefore, that there be a discipline that addresses this deficiency.  
Hence philosophy is compared to a pharmacy, where various medicines are opposed to various diseases.  
And thus it is said that there are as many parts of philosophy as there are ways in which man as man is to be perfected.  
Thirdly, the end of disciplines must be adequate, that is, not too broad nor too narrow.  
For if it is too broad, it is not proper; if too narrow, it is not perfect.  
Lastly, the end must be possible, that is, such a perfection of man as can certainly be provided by the discipline, to remedy the deficiency of nature in him; also some relation to theology, jurisprudence, and medicine.  
The end of each discipline can be attained if intention, use, and unimpaired means are considered.  
For by reason of execution, the end cannot always be achieved: and the abuse of means, also their neglect, and other external causes corrupting or impeding may prevent the end proposed by any discipline from being obtained by the one who has learned the discipline.  
This also pertains to the distinction of disciplines into ἀνεξούσιος, accurate, and συνοφαῖας, conjectural.  
For from the former, the end is always achieved, but not from the latter: as from the art of medicine health is not always achieved; nor persuasion from rhetoric.  
Here, too, the distinction between internal and external end may be applied.  
The former is always achieved by the artificer: the latter not always.  
Thus the internal end of rhetoric is to provide persuasive instruments: the external, to persuade.  
The orator always achieves the former; not necessarily the latter.

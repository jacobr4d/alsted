TECHNOLOGY, that is, the Doctrine of the properties, order, & number of disciplines.  

CHAPTER ONE.  
On the properties of disciplines.  
PRECEPTS.  

TECHNOLOGY is according to the previously known disciplines, concerning their nature and series.  
It is called in the same sense Technography.  

And it is general or special.  
General technology explains the properties or affections, order, and general division of the disciplines.  

The properties of disciplines regard the agreement or difference of them.  

The properties of disciplines concerning agreement are absolute or related.

Absolute properties concern disciplines considered in themselves.  
They are of the first or second class.  
Properties of the first class are concerning the end and subject of disciplines.  

Regarding the end, there are two properties: 1. To have a proper, adequate, and possible end, 2. To provide means sufficient to attain that end.  

Regarding the subject, there are likewise two properties: namely, to have a subject, 1. adequate, 2. stable.  

Absolute properties of the second class concern the matter, form, and adjuncts of disciplines.  

Regarding the matter, there are seven properties: namely, to have true, clear, easy, useful, necessary, homogeneous or specifically suitable, and sufficient precepts.  

Regarding the form, this is the property: to have a certain and methodical disposition of precepts; and to have it so arranged that there are two parts of each discipline, one general, the other special; whether the method is synthetic or analytic.  

Regarding adjuncts, it is common to disciplines that they are necessary, useful, certain, pleasant, etc.  

Related properties of disciplines are either concerning Nature, concerning the disciplines themselves, or indeed concerning their essence and existence.  

Regarding Nature, there are two properties; namely that art is an emulator of Nature, and at the same time is a more certain guide than Nature.  

Regarding the disciplines themselves, there are likewise two properties, namely subordination and binding of the forums.  
Subordination is where a lower discipline depends on some higher one: otherwise called subalternation.  

The binding of forums is where all disciplines harmoniously agree with each other.  

Concerning essence and existence, disciplines are either in idea or in subject.  

The properties of disciplines concerning difference are two.  
1. To have a subject of information, treatment, and operations.  
2. To have as the end either the contemplation of truth, the action of virtue, or the provision of instruments subservient to truth or virtue.

RULES.  

I. Technology presents the nature and positions of disciplines.  
Whereby two things must necessarily be known beforehand.  
Thus it happens that we reach a deeper understanding of the nature of any discipline.  
Then it is incredible to say how much this aids memory, if, whenever you read, hear, or see something, you immediately think to which discipline it pertains.  
In addition, it can more easily learn a discipline if its position is held in the realm of Encyclopedia, thus its agreement with other disciplines, and difference from the same.  
Finally, if there is to be a discussion on some theme, it is greatly beneficial to run through the series of disciplines and examine what can be brought forth from each discipline on that theme.  

II. The properties of disciplines are themselves the laws of establishing and examining philosophical disciplines.  
Just as man's properties argue the constitution of man from his matter and form, and are like the Lydian stone, by which the nature of man can and ought to be examined; so too the properties of disciplines are essential conditions required in establishing disciplines, and therefore to be applied in examining them.  
Thus, it is rightly said that they are the same rules for establishing and examining disciplines.

III. Each discipline should have a certain, proper, and adequate end.  
First, each discipline must have an end: because no discipline was invented recklessly or in vain, but all were established for the sake of some good.  
Hence, it is rightly said that God, nature, and art do nothing in vain.  
Then the end must be proper.  
Just as each discipline has its own essence, so too its own end.  
Moreover, that proper end should be commensurate to the general one, which is some perfection of man, and to the subject of each discipline.  
For it is man's imperfection that he cannot accurately know this or that knowable thing, hence it is necessary that a particular discipline remedies a particular deficiency of nature.  
Thus, for example, man cannot perfectly know the nature of the body.  
It is necessary, therefore, that there be a discipline that addresses this deficiency.  
Hence philosophy is compared to a pharmacy, where various medicines are opposed to various diseases.  
And thus it is said that there are as many parts of philosophy as there are ways in which man as man is to be perfected.  
Thirdly, the end of disciplines must be adequate, that is, not too broad nor too narrow.  
For if it is too broad, it is not proper; if too narrow, it is not perfect.  
Lastly, the end must be possible, that is, such a perfection of man as can certainly be provided by the discipline, to remedy the deficiency of nature in him; also some relation to theology, jurisprudence, and medicine.  
The end of each discipline can be attained if intention, use, and unimpaired means are considered.  
For by reason of execution, the end cannot always be achieved: and the abuse of means, also their neglect, and other external causes corrupting or impeding may prevent the end proposed by any discipline from being obtained by the one who has learned the discipline.  
This also pertains to the distinction of disciplines into ἀνεξούσιος, accurate, and συνοφαῖας, conjectural.  
For from the former, the end is always achieved, but not from the latter: as from the art of medicine health is not always achieved; nor persuasion from rhetoric.  
Here, too, the distinction between internal and external end may be applied.  
The former is always achieved by the artificer: the latter not always.  
Thus the internal end of rhetoric is to provide persuasive instruments: the external, to persuade.  
The orator always achieves the former; not necessarily the latter.

IV. Every discipline ought to perfectly provide sufficient means to achieve the goal.
It is not enough to merely indicate the end unless the means are demonstrated, which lead us to the end.
It is necessary, therefore, that every discipline provides means, which can lead us to the desired destination: and indeed perfectly.
Understand here the perfection of parts, as they call it, not of degrees.

V. Every discipline should have a subject whose knowledge is useful and necessary.
Every discipline must have a certain subject because it is necessary to teach something.
Moreover, that subject must be valuable, that is, arranged in such a way that its knowledge is notably useful and necessary; because common matters can be learned outside systems of disciplines; and useless matters should not be learned.
The subject of a discipline has two parts: the thing considered, and the mode of consideration, or material and formal.
The former can be taught in many disciplines at once, the latter in only one.
Hence the common saying: What is homogeneous in one art is heterogeneous in another; this is true concerning the mode of consideration.

VI. There ought to be seven properties of principles in any discipline.
Firstly, principles ought to be true, because an encyclopedia is not sophistical, nor, so to speak, a "mean philosophy" and "false writing," but it is philosophy, in the broad sense of this word.
Then, they ought to be clear; because if they are obscure, the art will not achieve its end, which is to rightly perfect a person, not to lead them ponderously.
Thirdly, they ought to be easy, for the same reason.
And indeed, it is the nature of truth to be both clear and easy.
Fourthly, they ought to be useful; because what ought to perfect a person is useful.
Fifthly, they ought to be necessary, not indeed absolutely and supremely, so that they are reciprocal, but yet in such a way that they produce knowledge, that is, such understanding which does not fluctuate.
From which it further follows that principles can sometimes be both negated and singular, if indeed the matter itself is of necessary negation and singular nature.
Sixthly, it is required that principles be homogeneous, since they ought to aim at the same subject and the same end, as to a center.
Even though the matters of the same discipline may differ in species, for example, man and beast in physics, yet principles of things differing in species can agree in species, for example, the principles of physics.
Finally, they will be sufficient; because perfect knowledge is required, not in degree, but in the essence of every useful and true thing.
From these, it is clear that sophistry, garrulity, and imperfection are especially contrary to disciplines.

VII. Theoretical disciplines should be taught by the synthetic method, practical and poetic by the analytic; and in both, two parts of each discipline should be established, one general, the other special.
The synthetic method is completed with the knowledge of the subject, principles, and affections or properties in general, and in specific treatment of the parts of the subject.
Here, remember this rule: The subject of the discipline is considered in the direct and oblique case.
For example, a natural body is the subject of physics in the nominative, that is, as such, and in the genitive, that is, of the body's principles, properties, and species.
The analytic method is completed with the knowledge of the end, subject, and means in general, and in specific application of means to a certain subject.
That former method of teaching and learning suits the sciences, since there a property is demonstrated about the subject through proximate causes; the latter suits prudence and arts, because there the end is sought through certain means to be introduced into the subject.
Moreover, because there is a general and special treatment in both, it is correctly established that there are two parts of each discipline, one general or common, the other special or proper.
But these are evident from the special treatment of each discipline.

VIII. Each discipline should be an imitator of nature, namely, nature when it is in proper condition.
This is a common saying among all philosophers, derived from Aristotle, who in Physics 2, chapter 2, states, "Art imitates nature," namely, so far as nature is in proper condition.
They imitate nature in those things where it is possible, whether those are under our control or beyond us; but not in those things which are apart from us.
Thus nature produces substance, which art cannot do: nature is an internal principle, art is not.
This imitation primarily consists in:
1. Art does nothing in vain but everything with a certain reason and for the sake of a certain good.
2. It always does what is best.
3. It does not offer superfluous things, nor does it lack in what is necessary.
4. It does everything with a certain order.

IX. Each discipline should be a more certain guide than nature, namely, when it is deficient.  
Nature is considered in two ways.  
First, inasmuch as it is in proper condition, even after the fall.  
For in this way, nature is the daughter of God.  
Then, inasmuch as it is corrupted by the fall: and thus, a soiled garment taints nature, that daughter of God.  
In the former way, art is an imitator of nature; in the latter, it is a more certain guide than nature: because it strives to supply the deficiency of nature.  

X. In divine matters, there is a threefold subordination: by reason of the subject, principles, and end.
Subordination is when a lower discipline depends on a higher one, either by reason of the subject and principles or by reason of the end.
The former is given in theoretical disciplines, the latter in practical ones.
Subordination by reason of the subject occurs when the subject of one discipline depends on the subject of another.
Subordination by reason of principles happens when the principles of one discipline depend on the principles of another.
Both subordination types are either general or special.
General subordination is when all disciplines subordinate to Metaphysics, since the subjects and principles of these disciplines depend on its subject and principles.
Thus, Economics is subordinated to Ethics, likewise Politics to Ethics, and Jurisprudence to Politics, by reason of their subjects and principles.
However, this subordination is considered too remote by philosophers.
Special subordination is when a subalternated discipline receives its subject, principles, and affections from the subalternating discipline.
This is called the most proper subordination, which occurs only in Mathematics.
In this manner, Music is subordinated to Arithmetic, and Optics to Geometry.
For Music derives its subject, principles, and affections from Arithmetic, and Optics from Geometry.
And this subordination has a place only in sciences because there are these three: subject, principles, and affections.
As for subordination by reason of the end, it exists only in practical disciplines, where a discipline is said to be subordinated by reason of the end, whose end is under the end of the superior discipline, such that the subalternating discipline practically directs the subalternated one and commands it to direct its actions to the superior end.
This is proper subordination found in practical disciplines.
In this way, Economics is subordinated to Politics; because Politics is concerned with a superior end and commands Economics to accommodate its actions to the superior end.
But besides this proper subordination by reason of the end, there is also improper subordination by reason of the end, where the subalternating discipline has no command over the subalternated one but considers the superior end contemplatively: in this manner, Ethics is subordinated to Physics.
For Physics considers only contemplatively the best operation of a human, which is the perfect operation of the intellectual part: moral philosophy, however, teaches what each person should do in order to live perfectly, that is, well and happily.

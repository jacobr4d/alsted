CHAPTER VII.  
General Divisions of Principles.

PRECEPTS.

The divisions of principles follow, general or common, fourteen in number, in this order.

I. Principles are simple or complex.  
Simple principles are the first terms of disciplines, insofar as they are considered outside of arrangement: e.g. being, essence, good, virtue, justice.  
Complex principles are axioms from which conclusions are deduced: as, What you do not wish to be done to you, do not do to another.  

II. Principles of cognition are such by themselves, or by accident.  
The former are called principles primarily, the latter secondarily.  
Principles by themselves are those which by their own force and nature are related to the principle or conclusion: as, It is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be.  
Principles by accident are those which are referred to the conclusion with a certain extrinsic and accidental respect: such as those which are called postulates.  

III. Principles are natural or supernatural.  
Natural principles depend on the light of right reason: or on the law of divine creation and governance: as, The whole is greater than any part of itself.  

Supernatural principles depend on the general revelation of God: as, Christ is our savior by merit and efficacy.  

IV. Principles are immediate or mediate.  
Immediate are those which have no other medium or principle by which they can be demonstrated a priori: as, God is.

Mediate are those which can be demonstrated from the principles of a higher science: as, Optical principles are demonstrated from geometrical principles.  
These can be called post-principles.

V. Principles are innate, acquired, or infused.  
Innate are those which man knows by the force of the intellect acting within him: as, Every whole is greater than its part.  
These are elegantly called by Scaliger zopyra: by others, the seeds of eternity.

Acquired are those which man learns by his own study: indeed either by instruction: as, Every circle consists of 360 degrees or parts. or by experience, as, Fish in certain places are black.

Infused are those which God inspires.

VI. Principles are common or proper.  
Common principles are those whose use many disciplines claim for themselves: such as the principles of Metaphysics and Logic.

Proper principles are those whose use pertains to only one discipline: such as the principles of Physics.

VII. Principles are real or notional.  
Real principles are those which are founded immediately in the thing itself; and are otherwise called protonoematic: such as the principles of Physics.

Notional principles are those which are founded on the comparison of things; and are otherwise called deuteronoematic principles: such as the principles of Logic and some Astronomical principles.

VIII. Principles are either most known in themselves, or most known to us.  
Most known in themselves are those which are most certain by their nature: such as, God is.

Most known to us are those which are most certain with respect to us: such as, The sun shines.  
For this is known by the senses.

IX. Principles are most general or subordinate.  

Most general principles are those which are principles in such a way that they are not conclusions.  
Such are either absolutely: as is this one, It is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be: or in a certain respect; in which sense, every discipline has some most general principle.  
Thus in Arithmetic, the most general principle is: Unity is the root and measure of every number.

Subordinate principles are those which are principles in such a way that they are also conclusions.

X. Principles are either truly and in themselves principles, or by convention.  
Principles which are truly and in themselves principles are most worthy: hence they are also called dignities, likewise truths.  
These two terms are very commonly used by Scholastics.

Principles by convention are those which are supposed for the sake of disputing or teaching: such as hypotheses.  
To this pertains the division of principles into counter-suppositions and hypotheses.

XI. Principles are natural (φυσικά) or positive (θετικά). Arist. 1. Posterior Analytics, towards the end.

Natural (φυσικά) principles are those to which the human intellect assents by native propriety without lengthy explanation: such as, The whole is greater than its part, Parents are to be honored.  
Aristotle calls these innate powers (δυναμεις συμφυτας).  
Damascenus from ancient philosophers calls them common notions (κοιναὶ ἔννοιαι).  
Others call them natural apprehensions (καταληπτικαὶ φυσικαὶ).  
The Stoics call them preconceptions, anticipations, and natural inclinations.

Positive (θετικά) principles are those either revealed by God or established in disciplines to make known and prove their conclusions.  
Aristotle calls these theses, just as he calls natural principles demands (αἰτήματα).  
Sturm elegantly calls axioms honorary declarations.

Positive principles include definitions, hypotheses, and postulates.

Definitions are those which explain a thing by genus and differentia: such as, Man is a rational animal.

Hypotheses are those, which although they have a demonstration, are assumed without demonstration: otherwise called conceded propositions: such as, All angles opposite by a cross are equal.

Postulates, called demands (αἰτήματα) by the Greeks, are propositions upon which the practitioner makes some agreement with the auditor: such as, To describe a circle with any center and interval.  
Otherwise called requests.

XII. Principles are primitive or derivative.  
The former are simply first; the latter are not.

XIII. Principles are confessed or doubtful.  
The former shine with their own light; the latter have light but do not show it at first glance.

XIV. Principles are regulative or regulated.  
The former govern the arrangement of art and action; the latter do not.

RULES.

I. The principle of cognition is an analogous genus.

That is, it has under it such species to which it is attributed unequally.  
For example, innate principles are more principles than postulates, and those principles that exist per se are more principles than those by accident.  
Just as substance is the measure of the accident, so more dignified principles are the measures of the less dignified.

II. Simple principles are either things or simple concepts; complex are complete sentences.

This is the first and highest division of the principle, whether it is simple or complex.  
For we progress from simple to composite.  
There are, however, two kinds of simple principles.  
First, there are things that lead us into the knowledge of others; then there are concepts or simple notions in the mind that depend on things.  
Thus God is the first name, and I am is the first verb.  
Therefore, these are called the first simple principles.  
Complex principles are called axioms, in the broad sense of the word, as the Stoics use it.
